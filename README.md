# How Did I Get That?

I always hated how I unlocked a new cosmetic item, and when I want to find out how I unlocked it, it simply said "OBTAINED BY: Penance" or "Hestia's Blessing".
Wouldn't it be cool if you could actually see what that penance was, how much it cost or how close you are to unlocking new cosmetics?

Well...

That's where How Did I Get That? comes in!

With HDIGT you will now be able to see how you obtained your various cosmetic items right from the inventory screen!

Pairs really well with my other mods

With all of these installed, you will be able to preview premium cosmetics for your character and on your weapons, and have a better store!

Currently works with weapon and character cosmetics from the following:

    Penance Rewards
    Hestia's Blessing Rewards
    Commissary Purchases

Including: Weapon skins, trinkets, character cosmetics, portrait frames, insignias, titles

How Did I Get That? Also shows the origin of unique items such as items from the Imperial Edition and for participating in the Beta.

Commodore's Vestures (Premium Shop) items do not currently show the price, as it is not possible to get the premium currency cost of items that are not currently in rotation in the shop. (Although, perhaps for the best - so I won't have to see how much I have spent in there)
